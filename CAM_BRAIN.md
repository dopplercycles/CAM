## Doppler Cycles Overview

Doppler Cycles is a motorcycle diagnostics and content creation business owned and operated by George in Gresham, Oregon. The business offers mobile motorcycle diagnostics and repair services across the Portland metro area, YouTube content creation covering diagnostics, motorcycle history, and barn finds, and a Highway 20 documentary project planned for June 2026. Future plans include a full shop with a rental fleet and advocacy work.

## George's Credentials and Experience

George has over 20 years of motorcycle industry experience. He is AMI (American Motorcyclist Institute) certified and factory trained by Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, and Ducati. He is a former Air Force Weather Observer. George is currently transitioning from warehouse work to full-time Doppler Cycles operation. His hands-on expertise spans diagnostics, repair, and restoration across American, Japanese, and European motorcycles.

## Service Area and Mobile Diagnostics

Doppler Cycles operates as a mobile motorcycle diagnostics and repair service covering the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area including Gresham, Portland, Beaverton, Hillsboro, Lake Oswego, and surrounding communities. George comes to the customer with diagnostic equipment and tools, eliminating the need to transport a non-running motorcycle to a shop.

## Harley-Davidson Specialty

George has extensive Harley-Davidson expertise, particularly with Twin Cam and Milwaukee-Eight (M-8) engines. Common diagnostic issues include oil pump failures on 2017-2020 M-8 Touring models, cam chain tensioner wear on Twin Cam engines, compensator noise and failure, voltage regulator and stator failures, and EFI (Electronic Fuel Injection) diagnostic codes. Harley-Davidson represents a significant portion of the Portland metro motorcycle market.

## Japanese Motorcycle Expertise

George is experienced with all four major Japanese manufacturers: Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki. Common diagnostic work includes carburetor synchronization and rebuild on older models, charging system diagnostics (stator, rectifier/regulator), valve adjustment on DOHC engines, fuel injection diagnostics on modern bikes, and chain and sprocket wear assessment. Japanese bikes represent the largest segment of motorcycles in the service area.

## European Motorcycle Expertise

George has Ducati factory training with specialized knowledge of the Desmodromic valve system, which requires periodic adjustment with special tools and shims. Additional European expertise covers BMW boxer and inline engines, Triumph parallel twins and triples, and KTM singles and twins. European motorcycles often require specialized diagnostic software and brand-specific knowledge.

## YouTube Content Strategy

Doppler Cycles YouTube content follows three pillars: diagnostic walkthroughs showing real-world troubleshooting, motorcycle history and technical deep dives, and barn find discoveries and restoration projects. CAM serves as the AI co-host "Cam" — the research desk to George's hands-on expertise. Cam always identifies as AI, which is a brand feature emphasizing transparency. The tone is knowledgeable, conversational, and pitched at the enthusiast level.

## Highway 20 Documentary Project

The Highway 20 documentary is planned for June 2026. Highway 20 is the longest road in the United States, spanning from Newport, Oregon to Boston, Massachusetts. The project will document a motorcycle journey along its entire length, combining ride footage with historical and cultural stops along the route. This is a major content milestone for the Doppler Cycles YouTube channel.

## Cam Identity and Persona

Cam is CAM's externally-facing AI co-host identity. "Like the camshaft, not the social media thing." Cam's role is the research desk to George's hands-on expertise. The tone is knowledgeable, conversational, and demonstrates enthusiast-level motorcycle depth. Key quote: "Think of me as the research desk and George as the guy who's actually bled on the machines." Cam always identifies as AI — transparency is a non-negotiable brand feature, not a disclaimer.

## Common Motorcycle Diagnostics

Frequent diagnostic scenarios that Doppler Cycles handles: No-start conditions — check battery voltage, starter relay, kill switch, sidestand switch, clutch safety switch, and fuel delivery. Misfires — inspect spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel injectors, compression, and cam timing. Electrical issues — test charging system output, parasitic draw, ground connections, and wiring harness integrity. Overheating — verify coolant level, thermostat operation, fan circuit, and water pump function. Mechanical noise — identify source (top end, bottom end, transmission, primary) and determine urgency.
