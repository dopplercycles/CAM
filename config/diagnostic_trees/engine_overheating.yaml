    type: question
    text: "Is the bike liquid-cooled or air/oil-cooled?"
    context: "Air-cooled bikes run hotter by nature, especially in traffic. Liquid-cooled bikes have more components to diagnose."

  coolant_level:
    type: question
    text: "Check coolant level in the overflow tank (engine cold). Is it at the proper level?"
    context: "Check the overflow/expansion tank first — there are LOW and HIGH marks. Only check the radiator cap level if the overflow is empty."

    type: question
    text: "Can you see any coolant leaks? Check under the bike, around hoses, water pump, and radiator."
    context: "Coolant is usually bright green, orange, or pink. Check hose connections, water pump weep hole, and radiator for wet spots."

  fan_check:
    type: question
    text: "When the temp gauge gets high, does the radiator fan turn on?"
    context: "Let the bike idle until it gets hot. The fan should kick on around 200-220F (93-104C). Listen and watch for the fan."

  thermostat_check:
    type: question
    text: "Feel the radiator hoses with the engine at operating temp. Is the top hose hot and the bottom hose warm?"
    context: "If the top hose is hot but the bottom hose is cold, the thermostat isn't opening. Both should be warm/hot at operating temp."
    safety: "Hoses can be very hot — touch carefully."
    answers:
      - label: "Both hoses warm/hot — thermostat opening"

    type: question
    text: "Inspect the radiator. Are the fins clean and unobstructed? Any visible damage or bending?"
    context: "Mud, bugs, and debris blocking airflow is a very common cause of overheating. Also check for bent fins blocking more than 20% of the surface."

  oil_check:
    type: question
    text: "Check the oil level and condition. Is the oil at the correct level and does it look normal?"

    recommended_actions:
      - "Identify the exact leak source — hose, clamp, water pump, radiator, or gasket"
      - "Pressure test the cooling system (15-18 PSI) to find small leaks"
      - "Replace leaking hose or tighten clamp"
      - "Check water pump weep hole — if leaking, the pump seal is failing"
