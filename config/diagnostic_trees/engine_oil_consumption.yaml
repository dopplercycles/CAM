      - "Plan for top-end disassembly"
      - "Replace base gasket and inspect cylinder/case mating surfaces"
      - "While apart, inspect piston and rings"
      - "Check for excessive crankcase pressure (blocked breather)"
    possible_parts:
      - "Cylinder base gasket"

      - "Pressure test cooling system"
      - "Check oil for milky contamination"
